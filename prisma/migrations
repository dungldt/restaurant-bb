The migrations directory is intended to contain migration files generated by Prisma, which are created automatically when you run Prisma commands to apply changes to your database schema. Therefore, this directory should be empty initially.

The contents of the file /my-nextjs-app/my-nextjs-app/prisma/migrations is intentionally left blank.
